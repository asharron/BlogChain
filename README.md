# What This Is
For my capstone at Berea College, I and another student were paried with an Alumni to created a proof-of-concept prototype for his new blockchain start up. This involved us creating a website, database, and blockchain that would scaffold later designs.

# How It Works
Currently, we are hosting a running version of this code on a Linode server. Once you have a mysql server set up, you can run create_db.py and then run app.py to start the website. 

# What It Does
Currently, the blockchain aspect is still under development. Most of the website, however, is functional. It allows users to sign up and also has a job board. What we are currently working on is creating blogs on the blockchain, adding new nodes to the blockchain, and allowing users to upvote blogs.
